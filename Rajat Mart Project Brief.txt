Objective :

RK Discount mart is a small supermarket owned by Mr. Rajat Khandelwal. He wants a dashboard where he
can track how well Discount Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity
Sold).
He would also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions.
Mr. Rajat assumes that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would
like this confirmed by the data.
